# 🌟 Kalpana Chawla Tribute Portfolio 🌟  

## 🏆 About the Project  
This project was created as part of a **Women’s Day Web Designing Challenge**, where participants had only **one hour** to design and deploy a portfolio webpage from scratch—without using pre-built templates.  

I chose to build a **tribute portfolio** for **Kalpana Chawla**, the first Indian woman in space, who remains an icon of perseverance, courage, and inspiration for millions worldwide.  

📌 **The challenge allowed AI assistance, but execution, logic, and design skills within the time were the real test!**  

## 🎨 Features
